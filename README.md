# SpeechRecognition
In this attempt, I have tried to explore the speech recognition feature in Python using pyaudio and speech_recognition packages. 
By combining Speech Recognition with Image manipulation techniques, this program allows user to voice input the commands to choose to apply Sepia filter to the image or create a reflection of the given image.
The commands to be given as follows:
1) Sepia filter, user should say 'apply filter' through the microphone.
2) To create Reflection, user should speak 'reflection' through the microphone.

The program is created using Python v3.6. and utilizes google recogniser for speech recognition.

In order to use a different image, replace the image in the 'images' folder and change the value of 'pic' variable.
